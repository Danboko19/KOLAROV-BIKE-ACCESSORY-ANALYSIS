# OBSERVATION

According to the report generated by the company the company a total profit of $32,221,100.00, with a total sales of 1345316 over the last 6 years, there was rapid growth in the sales made yearly until 2015 with a total unit sales 289517 compare to 2014 which has a total sales of 379585. It's also observed that USA is the country with most sales, and most profit generated.

# RECOMMENDATION

I will like to bring the attention the boards to the low in sales of the following product "Mountain-100 Black,42 which record a low sales of 73", "touring 3000 blue,50 which has a total unit sales of 70", "Mountain-500 Silver,52 which has a total unit sales of, 52" "Road-650 Red,52 which has very low sales of 52",  and "Mountain-500 Black, 52 which has the lowest sales record of just 40" over the last six(6) years.
As the United States of America recorded the most sales recorded by any country i think the company should supplier more of there product to the region. 

And also will like to recommend increases in production and supply of the product in the month of April and december as those two months always record a massive rate in demands.
